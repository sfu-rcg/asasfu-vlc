Installation
------------

This module relies on the asasfu-yumrepos module to ensure your repos are installed but they do not need to have enabled=1 as this module was made to support switching repos on only as required by the specific module.

The repos required have been hard coded so this module will have to be maintained as repositories change and new linux distros are released and added.

We're always curious how we can make this more functional and modular for everyone's greater good in systems automation
